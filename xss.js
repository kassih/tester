Finding: Blind OS Command Injection via GitHub Build Process
Description:
Blind OS Command Injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on a server without directly observing the output. The vulnerability arises when user-supplied input is improperly sanitized before being passed to system commands. In this scenario, the attacker can infer the success or failure of the command execution based on indirect indicators, such as build logs or error messages.

  During the test, it was observed that by editing a GitHub file and injecting a callback to a controlled server, it was possible to trigger the application build process using the /build command after committing the changes. During this build process, the logs revealed an error message stating: "Error: You must use HTTPS instead of HTTP." This message confirmed that the injected command was processed and partially executed, indicating the ability to execute OS commands within the build environment. The lack of direct command output confirms that this is a blind OS command injection vulnerability.
Impact:
Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands during the build process, potentially compromising the build environment.

Sensitive Information Disclosure: Commands may be used to leak environment variables or configuration files through error messages or build logs.

System Compromise: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute destructive commands, install backdoors, or extract data from the server.

Build Poisoning: Attackers could manipulate the build process to introduce malicious code, potentially affecting the application and downstream users.

Recommendations:
Input Validation: Sanitize all user inputs before passing them to system commands. Avoid using unsanitized user data in shell commands.

Secure Build Configuration: Configure GitHub actions and build scripts to restrict the use of shell commands or user inputs that are not properly validated.

Error Handling: Avoid exposing detailed error messages that could hint at successful command execution. Use generic error messages instead.

Use HTTPS Strictly: Ensure that all callbacks and external requests are made using HTTPS to prevent potential command injection through HTTP links.

Code Review and Hardening: Conduct thorough code reviews of build scripts and CI/CD pipelines to identify and mitigate risks related to command execution.

Monitoring and Logging: Implement logging to detect abnormal activity during the build process, such as unusual callbacks or execution patterns.

Access Control: Limit the ability of users to modify build configuration files or scripts, especially those that can trigger command execution.

  Finding: Missing Security Leaks Check in GitHub Build Process
Description:
During the penetration testing process, it was observed that the GitHub build pipeline includes an automated security scan designed to detect potential leaks within the codebase after a new commit. This scan is intended to identify sensitive information such as API keys, tokens, and other secrets embedded within the source code.

To evaluate the effectiveness of this security measure, a test was conducted by injecting a GitHub personal access token into the mavn.cmd script within the repository. The modified code was then committed and pushed to trigger the build process. Although the scan is capable of detecting tokens when embedded directly in source code files, it failed to identify the token within the mavn.cmd configuration file, indicating that such files are a blind spot for the scan.

This oversight indicates a critical lapse in the security scan configuration, as it did not flag the presence of the sensitive token within configuration scripts. As a result, potentially sensitive credentials could be pushed and retained in the codebase without triggering alerts, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

Impact:
Credential Exposure: Sensitive tokens and secrets embedded within configuration files may remain undetected, leading to potential unauthorized access if the repository becomes public or is compromised.

Compliance Risk: Failure to detect sensitive data leaks in configuration files may violate internal security policies and external compliance regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

Build Integrity Compromise: Attackers can exploit this gap by intentionally injecting sensitive information into configuration files to bypass security checks, compromising build artifacts.

Recommendations:
Enhance Security Scans: Extend the scope of leak detection tools to include not only source code files but also configuration files (e.g., .cmd, .env, .conf).

Custom Rules: Configure the scanning tool to include patterns and file types commonly associated with configuration scripts, including mavn.cmd.

Pre-Commit Checks: Integrate local pre-commit hooks that scan for leaks before allowing commits, particularly focusing on configuration and build script files.

Secure Token Management: Store sensitive information in secure vaults or environment variables rather than directly embedding them in configuration files.

Regular Configuration Audits: Conduct periodic reviews and updates of the security scanning rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all file types, including build and configuration scripts.

Let me know if you would like further assistance with mitigating this vulnerability or configuring more secure scanning practices.

Finding: Unauthorized Command Execution on GitHub Commits Without Reviewer Permission
Description:
During the penetration testing process, it was observed that an unauthorized user could execute specific commands on GitHub commits without requiring reviewer permission. This vulnerability stems from improper permission management within the GitHub repository configuration, which allows users to trigger build-related commands, such as scan, build, all, and others, directly from commit actions without undergoing a review process.

The issue was identified when the testing team discovered that by making specific changes to a GitHub file and committing those changes, it was possible to initiate automated build and scan processes without the involvement of an authorized reviewer. Typically, these commands should be restricted to maintainers or users with explicit permissions, but due to a misconfiguration or lack of enforcement in the repository settings, these commands were executed without any oversight.

This flaw enables any contributor with push access to manipulate the build process, including triggering scans, initiating builds, or running other automated tasks. This lack of access control compromises the integrity of the build pipeline and increases the risk of malicious code injection or unintended build modifications.
