Open Redirect via Meta Refresh Tag
üìÑ Description:
The application includes a redirect mechanism implemented using an HTML <meta http-equiv="refresh"> tag, where the destination URL is controlled by user input. Specifically, the parameter accepts a value like ;url=//evil.com, resulting in an automatic redirection to an external domain after a short delay. Since there is no validation or restriction on the target URL, an attacker can craft malicious links that appear to belong to the trusted domain but ultimately redirect users to untrusted or phishing websites.

üîç Observation:
When accessing a crafted link containing ;url=//evil.com, the page loads a meta tag such as <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=//evil.com">, which causes the browser to redirect to the external site. This behavior can be exploited by attackers to conduct phishing attacks or to trick users into interacting with malicious content after trusting the initial domain.

‚ö†Ô∏è Impact:
This vulnerability enables attackers to perform phishing attacks by disguising malicious URLs as legitimate ones. A victim might click a link pointing to the trusted domain (e.g., example.com), but would be silently redirected to an attacker-controlled site. This can lead to stolen credentials, malware installation, or trust erosion for the affected application.

To mitigate this issue, user input used in redirection logic‚Äîespecially within HTML meta tags‚Äîshould be strictly validated and restricted to a predefined allowlist of trusted domains. If redirection is necessary, it should be handled server-side with proper validation and logging. Where possible, avoid using client-side redirection methods such as <meta http-equiv="refresh"> entirely, as they provide minimal control and are more prone to abuse.



Screenshot Title:
The screenshot below shows the application rendering a <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=//evil.com"> tag in the HTML response, which triggers an automatic client-side redirection to an external domain without any validation.
