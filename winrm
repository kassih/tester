Title: Stored XSS via SVG File Upload in Policy Booklet
Observation:
During the assessment, it was found that the application allows users to upload SVG files as policy booklets. However, the file upload mechanism does not adequately sanitize SVG content, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript. When a user clicks on the uploaded SVG file, the embedded script executes in their browser context, leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This vulnerability could be exploited to steal session tokens, perform unauthorized actions on behalf of users, or redirect them to malicious websites.

Recommendation:
To mitigate this vulnerability, implement strict validation and sanitization of uploaded SVG files by:

Disabling inline JavaScript execution within SVG files by stripping <script> and event handler attributes (e.g., onload, onclick).
Converting SVG files to a safe format such as PNG before storage.
Enforcing Content Security Policy (CSP) rules to prevent the execution of inline scripts.
